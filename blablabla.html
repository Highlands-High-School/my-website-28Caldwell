<h1>i already did the gibberish bit up by the title</h1>
<p>i guess i could probably pick a topic to talk about. apparently this is a paragraph and i find that word miserable</p>
<h2>paragraphs are annoying</h2>
<p>if you dont already agree with what im saying you arent gonna get me; paragraphs are so pretentious. you think youre better than a normal sentence because theres a couple of lines? 
who the hell are you to be such a fancy word. "Sentence" easy to spell for kids and dementiacs alike. 'paragraph' 'pairagraf' 'paragraf' shut up dude</p>
