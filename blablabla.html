<h1>i already did the gibberish bit up by the title</h1>
<p>i guess i could probably pick a topic to talk about. <p>
</p>apparently this is a paragraph i find that word miserable</p>
<h2>paragraphs are annoying</h2>
<p>if you dont already agree with what im saying you arent gonna get me; paragraphs are so pretentious.<p>
<p>you think youre better than a normal sentence because theres a couple of lines? </p>
<p>who are you to be such a fancy word. "Sentence" is easy to spell for kids and dementiacs alike.</p>
<p>'paragraph' 'pairagraf' 'paragraf' 'pair of graphs' shut up dude</p>
