<h1>what do i write this paragraph about</h1>
<p>i guess i could probably pick a topic to talk about. </p> <br>
<p>if i had stuff to edit itd be easier to mess around with stuff</p>
<p>apparently this is a paragraph<br> i find that word miserable</p> 
<h2><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paragraph"> paragraphs</h2></a> are annoying as a concept</h2>
  <hr>
<p>if you dont already agree with what im saying you arent gonna get me; <br>
  paragraphs are so pretentious.</p> <br>
<p>they think theyre better than a normal sentence because theres a couple of lines? </p> <br>
<p>who are they to be such a fancy word. "Sentence" is easy to spell for kids and dementiacs alike.</p> <br>
<p>'paragraph' 'pairagraf' 'paragraf' 'pair of graphs' shut up dude</p>
